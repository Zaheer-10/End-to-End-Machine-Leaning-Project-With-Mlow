''''
The utils.py file in a Python application serves as a utility module. 
This module contains various functions that can be used throughout the application to perform common tasks like error checking, logging, data manipulation, etc.

By maintaining a separate utils.py module, we can ensure consistency and cleanliness in our code. 
This way, instead of writing the same utility function again and again in different modules, we can simply import the desired function(s) from utils.py once and use it everywhere in our application.
